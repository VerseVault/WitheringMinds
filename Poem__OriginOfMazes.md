Interjections, they made my maze
Fragmentations, they mould my maze
Tesselations, they mint my maze
A maze for a miniscule mortal
That is all I need

It is being built
Far from complete
Far from conjugal
Far from cohesive

Are mazes symmetric
Are mazes condensed 
Are mazes conjugal

Are mazes built from edges
Are mazes built from center
Are mazes built from tangents

From momentary mazes to monumental mazes
From mirrored mazes to molten mazes

Let there be stones and henges
Let there be lights and shadows
Let there be dizziness and darkness
