Spells are broken
In the locus of life
Walls are warping
In the maze of minds
There are curves
There are cliffs
There are coins
There are crucibles

Tangents do not lie
Tales do not tie
Edges of ephemerals
They are so near
They are so clear

Prisms do not erode
Pyramids do not evade
Pigments do not corrode
In the locus of lumen
